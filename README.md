Take back the net - and the nation. Improving Civic Engagement using Technology & the Internet!

## Get off the internet!
Conventional wisdom says politics and the internet is a bad mix. 

Don't read the comments.

Don't feed the trolls.

But people are not going to get off the internet. Even when we had dial up we were on the internet, and now it's in our pockets, our TVs, our microwaves. Internet isn't going anywhere. Neither are the extremists and hate groups who thrive there.

Extremists, racists, supremacists, and other hate groups share their messages in comment sections, in Tweets, on forums like Reddit and the chans. It has never been a secret, but we have willingly avoided looking at who is posting and what they believe. 

In fact, in 2016 large numbers of Americans were surprised to find out how toxic the internet, and our nation, really is. 

Many of us also discovered our news outlets have given over to clickbait marketing, tabloids share equal face time with journalism, and government groups have embraced big data to gerrymander our districts and discredit scientific information.

### Also surprising

Many people had no idea they could contact their representatives throughout the year to weigh in on issues. 

Many people didn't even know who their representatives were.

And some representatives didn't know that voters pay their salaries and they work for us.

Large gaps of standard civic involvement know-how are missing for many Americans. We've forgotten things we learned back in high school, we slept through some classes, and some things we were never taught to begin with. 

### Technology is user-driven

Technology adapts to those who use it and the internet is no different. Hate speech and misinformation live online as much as in real life. We as tech makers and users have the opportunity to decide to let them have the net or to push back. 

We get to make the internet how we want it to be. Just like we get to make our country how we want it to be. When we are passive, when we avoid engagement, when we stay in our bubbles, our representatives give in to corruption and the internet gets nasty. We have a responsibility to engage just as we are, so that we also have representation.

# _Education, Empathy, and Engagement_

Fifth by Midwest aims to responsibly encourage civic engagement by providing a non-partisan, judgement-free, empathy-driven space to learn and talk about politics. Engagement should be as easy and unobtrusive as using any other social app. 

We will teach moderate citizens the importance of keeping politics in the visible realm, and how to it with empathy and minimal friction. 

## Removing barriers with technology

People who join 5XMW will be validated based on their home address, and automagically matched up with all of their local, state, and federal representatives. Because users are validated, representatives can be assured user content comes from actual constituents of their districts. 

In addition, citizens and reps alike will be able to:
- Contact each other directly
- Conduct polling
- Plan events like Town Halls or rallies
- See Report Cards on politicians and political organizations

5XMW will promote the research, or the capabilities, to determine effectiveness and cost of policies. We should use those to drive new policies, rather than ideologies that can now be empirically proven right or wrong.

### Transparent Representation

Each representative will have Political Report Cards, easy-to-see data including
- Donors ranked by funding amount
- Voting history
- A calculated score comparing voting history to donor wishes vs constituent majority
- Political affiliations and a calculated score reflecting voting history along party lines vs constituent majority
- Campaign promises, kept or not kept

Eventually we will build the Report Card feature out to cover political organizations, think tanks, news sources, and more.
